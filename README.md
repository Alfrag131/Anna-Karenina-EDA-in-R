# Anna-Karenina-EDA-in-R
1. Word Frequency Analysis

   We analyze the frequency of words in the novel after cleaning and preprocessing the text, with a focus on identifying the top 20 most frequently used non-trivial words — excluding common stop words and the names of main characters.

2. Character Mentions

   Narrative structure and character dynamics in Leo Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina using quantitative text analysis. By leveraging character name normalization, mention frequency tracking, and visual storytelling through heatmaps, we provide a data-driven perspective on the novel’s key figures and their prominence across the storyline.

3. Narrative Network Analysis

   Our goal is to explore how characters interact across the novel’s timeline and to uncover hidden narrative structures and relationships through computational literary analysis.

4. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

   This visualization applies topic modeling to Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) in R. The goal is to uncover hidden themes and semantic structures across the novel by analyzing recurring word patterns across segments of the text.

5. Sentiment Analysis

   This visualization performs a rolling sentiment analysis of Anna Karenina using the Bing lexicon. The goal is to visualize the emotional dynamics of the novel by mapping how positive and negative sentiments fluctuate across the narrative.
   
   To observe sentiment trends over time, we calculated rolling means (moving averages) with two different window sizes:
   200 words: for local, fine-grained sentiment changes
   2000 words: for broader narrative trends

6. Word Frequency Analysis for Main Characters

   These visualizations perform a contextual lexical analysis of the main characters in Anna Karenina, focusing on the words that surround each character throughout the text. The aim is to understand how language, themes, and emotional tone vary depending on the character — and thus gain insight into how Tolstoy constructs their psychological and narrative space.
